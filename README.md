# DinoMight?
> Dinosaurs deserve to know when an asteroid *might* hit. Developers deserver to know when something *might* error.

## What?
DinoMight is a functional style error handling library for `Deno` and `Node.js`. As a successor to [Tryify](https://github.com/twilsoft/tryify), DinoMight's goal is to empower developers to know the potential errors that may lurk in their code and handle them deliberately. Let's stop `throw`ing stuff around, shall we?

## When?
Now! Well kinda. This library is pre-release and currently only support synchronous operatios. Stay tuned for async and some docs.
